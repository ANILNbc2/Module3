Q1 : Given an integer array find any pair(i,j) such that A[i]=A[j] and |i-j| is
    minimum.

Solution :
    Create an HP of value, greatest Index.
    for each value, if the value exists, then find greatest index - current
    index. If the diff is min value, then update min and track the 2 indexes,
    also update greatest index to current index.

Q2 : Given an integer array, find the count of all the pairs(i,j)  such that
    A[i] = A[j]
Solution : Create hashmap of A[i], count of A[i].
           parse the hashmap and perform sum(count of A[i]* count of A[i]-1)/2)
           for total count of pairs.

Q3 : Given an Integer array, find the longest chain of consequtive elements.
Solution : Brute force solution : Sort the array and find the longest chain.
Better solution : We dont need to actually sort the array, we can add to hasmap
or a hash set as step 1 and then find the longest chain, similar to brute force
solution.
In the better solution, we will consider a key only if the key-1 does not exist.
If key-1 does not exist, then we will find the chain until key+1.. exists.
