Q1 : Given a character array S, as line of words, return the line after
    reversing word by word. SC = O(1).
Solution :  Step 1 : Reverse the string first.
            Step 2 : Swap character by character once you see space.

Q2 : Given a string S, check whether it is  possible too rearrange the
characters such that there is no boring substring in the string.
Boring String : length=2, and they are consequtive characters.
eg : abd : boring substring, converted to adb.. : So true for the question.
dba : boring substring, converted to bda.. : So true for the question.
aab : boring substring, cannot be converted as any combination contains a boring
 substring.

Solution :  Create 2 arrays for even and odd characters.
            Sort the even and odd character arrays.
            Check if the min of odd and max of even or min of even and max of
            odd make a boring substring. If not, we are good, If they do, then
            we cannot make the required substring.
